Trackerfs shows hits from a Tracker query as symlinks.  Pretty simple.

-=Requirements=-
Trackerfs requires recent(cvs) versions of:
* Tracker
* Python FUSE bindings (can possibly use 0.71)

In addition, Trackerfs requires:
* libfuse2 (>= 2.4.2)
* fuse-utils (>= 2.4.2)
* dbus (~ 0.60)
* python2.4-dbus (~ 0.60)
If you use Ubuntu Dapper, these can be installed via apt-get

I've heard that the DBus API has changed in recent versions, so cutting-edge DBus -may not work- with Trackerfs.

-=Installation=-
Copy trackerfs.py to somewhere in your path, e.g. /usr/local/bin

-=Usage=-
trackerfs.py mountpoint -o query=search_term

For instance, I do "trackerfs.py ~/search -o query=katie" when I want to find all the pictures of my wife :)

-=Bugs=-
Assuredly.  Trackerfs doesn't do much error-checking.  Hits to files with the same filename result in hits named exactly the same thing.
