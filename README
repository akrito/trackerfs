Trackerfs shows hits from a Tracker query as symlinks.  Pretty simple.

-=Requirements=-
Trackerfs requires recent(cvs) versions of:
* Tracker
* Python FUSE bindings (can possibly use 0.71)

In addition, Trackerfs requires:
* libfuse2 (>= 2.4.2)
* fuse-utils (>= 2.4.2)
* dbus (~ 0.60)
* python2.4-dbus (~ 0.60)
If you use Ubuntu Dapper, these can be installed via apt-get

I've heard that the DBus API has changed in recent versions, so cutting-edge DBus -may not work- with Trackerfs.


-=Installation=-
Copy trackerfs.py to somewhere in your path, e.g. /usr/local/bin


-=Usage=-
trackerfs.py mountpoint

To search, create a directory in the Trackerfs root.  It will be populated with symlinks from the tracker search for "directory_name".  You cannot delete directories, but you *can* rename them when you want to search for something else.  Create as many directories as you wish.


-=Bugs=-
Trackerfs doesn't do much error-checking.
"Invalid argument" when ls'ing a directory with no hits.

-=Todo=-
Allow special directories of the form "tag:query", which cause trackerfs to search for files tagged with "query".
Also, allow other "xxx:query", where trackerfs will search for all files with metadata type "xxx" set to "query"

Fix vfstat return values (fuse API changed)

Save directories for next time

Make Trackerfs safe for multi-threaded operation
